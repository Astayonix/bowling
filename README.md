# Bowling Game
======================
A fun, automated, single-player bowling game

<h2>Overview</h2>
The bowling game is a one-player bowling script written in Python that takes a single argument (username) to run.  The user can then type 'True' or 'False' to indicate the use of bumpers.  The game then automatically sets up the 10-pin bowling lane and randomly generates rolls that either hit or miss the pins for a full 10-frame game of bowling.  After all 10 frames are complete, the game automatically scores the player's game according to the rules of bowling[1] and displays the user's scorecard.

<h5> Assumptions </h5>
Scoring Rules:
I set the rules for scoring the user's game per the instructions in this video.

Version 2.0:
The next version will have a method for handling the possible 3 balls in the 10th frame (e.g. if a 2 strikes are thrown in the last frame, the user gets 3 additional balls to throw).  There will also be an additional method added to see if the user wants to play a new game after completing all 10 frames of play.

<h5> Feature List </h5>
- Fun ASCII bowling lane visuals
- Almost fully automated player experience
- Randomized events
